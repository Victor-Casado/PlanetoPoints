# Install Guide:

**Cloning the Project**

1. In terminal, clone the repository to your local machine:

        git clone git@github.com:Victor-Casado/PlanetoPoints.git


**Installing Dependencies**

1. Navigate to [Python Download Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install python3 on your machine

   **<ins>Note: all python commands are denoted here as python3, but on your machine they may be python or something else</ins>**
   
2. Create a virtual environment by running

3. Activate the virtual environment

   On linux/mac (I believe but have not tested on mac):

        . foo/bin/activate
   On windows:

        . foo/Scripts/activate


4. In your terminal, run the command

        pip install -r PlanetoPoints/requirements.txt -r
